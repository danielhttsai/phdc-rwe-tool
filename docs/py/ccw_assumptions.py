"""Clone-Censor-Weight (CCW) assumption checks C1–C5 — following Hernán (2018),
Maringe et al. (2020), Gaber et al. (2024). Like other target-trial methods, the
core identifying assumptions are untestable from data alone, so we are honest
(blue 'info' cards) and surface the diagnostics that ARE checkable: positivity
(overlap), the weight distribution, and enough events.

Each check returns {id, title, status, headline, plain, term, metrics:[...]};
run_dashboard returns {"checks": [...]}.
